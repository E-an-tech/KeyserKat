      "question": "Technology has played an important role in sports. For example, the implementation of technologies such as PITCH/fx, Rapsodo PITCHING 2.0, among others, has made it easier to detect the speed of baseball pitches with greater accuracy. In the history of Major League Baseball, the record speed of a ball during a pitch was 46.9 m/s. Assuming that a ball with a mass of 0.145 kg traveled at that speed and stopped in the catcher's glove 0.01 s after the pitch, calculate the average acceleration of the ball. Use the formula a = (v_f - v_i) / (t_f - t_i).",

Using Newton’s First and Third Laws of Motion, explain why the box remains still before the push and why it eventually stops after being pushed.",
      "options": [
        "The box remains still because of inertia, and it stops because friction acts in the opposite direction of motion.",
        "The box remains still because there are no forces acting on it, and it stops because the applied force disappears.",
        "The box moves because gravity pulls it forward, and it stops when normal force becomes greater.",
        "The box remains still because friction pushes it forward, and it stops because inertia decreases over time."
