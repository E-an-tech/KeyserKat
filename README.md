🧩 Project Origin

KeyserKat was born in GeoGebra as a perfectly symmetrical, straight-line cat. Inspired by educational platforms like Khan Academy for accessible teaching, Duolingo for gamification and user retention, and video games like Mario Galaxy for intuitive design, it evolved into a concept meant to help students(especially 12th graders) learn on their own terms.

Originally prototyped in MIT App Inventor, KeyserKat is now being rebuilt in Python using Kivy with Anaconda Environment, focusing on Physics as its first subject. The choice of Physics was made because it’s often one of the most challenging STEM subjects for students, including the creators themselves.

🎯 Core Philosophy

Geometric World: Every visual element follows geometric design principles.

German Names: Characters are named in German to reflect their roles.

Keyser (Emperor): Represents the user, ruler of their own learning journey.

Iteraktiv (Interactive): A geometric bird acting as a reset mechanism and Keyser’s companion.

Guava: A conceptual side character still in early development.
