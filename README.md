# KeyserKat

**The only learning app you'll ever need**

## Project Origin

Keyser was born in GeoGebra, as a perfectly symmetrical, straight-line cat. Inspired by educational platforms like **Khan Academy** for it's capacity to teach lots of students in flexible ways, **Duolingo** for gamefication and user retention, and games like **Mario Galaxy** for easy to entry and intuity, KeyserKat evolved into an app to help students (especially in their last year of high school) learn on their own terms.

This app started as a prototype on **MIT App Inventor** and is now being rebuilt using **Python**.

## Core Philosophy

- **Geometric World**: This applies to Keyser and everything he interacts with has to follow these rules.
- **Names in German**: All characters are named in German to reflect their function.
  - `Keyser` (Emperor): The user is the ruler of their own learning journey.
  - `Iteraktiv`(Iteractive)(In progress): A circular bird that acts as a reset mechanism, this bird and Keyser are best buds.
  - `Guava`: (TBD) A potential side character still in concept phase.

## Features (in progress)
- Modular content structure (starting with external content, later own lessons)
- Progress tracking
- A geometrical UI fully intuitive minimal written instructions required
- Gamification elements
- Python-based backend and UI

## Technologies
- MIT App Inventor (prototype)
- Python 3.10.16
- Kivy
- Anaconda 
- VS Code
- Github dev 
- (Future plans) Finishing the app with the entire high school curriculum (based on the one found in the public school one of the Department of Education of Puerto Rico)

##  Inspirations

- **Khan Academy**
- **Duolingo**
- **Mario Galaxy**
- **Classic animation principles**
- **Our undying love for cats**
- **Terminal**
- **Matrix movie**
- **RPG**

All early project code names and planning documents are in **Spanish**, as part of our developer tradition (like Nintendo’s “Project Dolphin”).

**Made with lots of hope, ambition, fun by two friends building the future of learning with not a lot of meowney.**
