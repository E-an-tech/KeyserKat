  "A skateboarder performs a horizontal jump at 5.0 m/s from a height of 2.0 m. How far horizontally will he fall? Calculate the flight time by solving the first equation. Then determine the distance by solving the second formula. (First equation: Δy = v_iy * t + 1/2 * g * t^2; Second equation: v = d / t)",
  "Observe the position-time graph of a vehicle that initially begins moving eastward and travels along a straight road. Indicate the total displacement of the vehicle at the end of the journey.",
  "Technology has played an important role in sports. For example, the implementation of technologies such as PITCH/fx, Rapsodo PITCHING 2.0, among others, has made it easier to detect the speed of baseball pitches with greater accuracy. In the history of Major League Baseball, the record speed of a ball during a pitch was 46.9 m/s. Assuming that a ball with a mass of 0.145 kg traveled at that speed and stopped in the catcher's glove 0.01 s after the pitch, calculate the average acceleration of the ball. Use the formula a = (v_f - v_i) / (t_f - t_i).",
  "During a baseball game, a ball with a mass of 0.145 kg is thrown at a speed of 46.9 m/s and comes to a complete stop in the catcher’s glove in 0.01 s. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force (F = m * a) that acted on the ball to stop it.",
  "A cyclist rides uphill without stopping. From which type of energy does the bicycle gain mechanical energy? (Adapted from Zitzewitz, 2004. Physics Principles and Problems. McGraw-Hill, p. 262.)",
  "In a crash test, a red car with a mass of 2.80 x 10^3 kg is moving at 14.5 m/s and comes to a stop after colliding with a stationary car anchored to the ground. Calculate the change in the car's kinetic energy using ΔKE = KEf - KEi, where KE = (1/2)mv^2.",
  "Photocells, like those found in solar panels and calculators, work using the photoelectric effect, which describes a material's ability to generate electricity when exposed to light. If the threshold frequency for silicon is 3.2 x 10^13 Hz, calculate the maximum wavelength (λ) that can produce the photoelectric effect. (Use c = λ·f, where c = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.)",
  "When two wave pulses meet and overlap, what results are observed in cases (a) and (b)?",
  "In the following circuit, which of the statements is correct?",
  "The diagram shows the electrical circuit that powers a car's front headlights. This circuit is designed so that each lamp receives its full share of power. The headlights are connected in what type of circuit?"
