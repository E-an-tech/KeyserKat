  "A skateboarder performs a horizontal jump at 5.0 m/s from a height of 2.0 m. How far horizontally will he fall? Calculate the flight time by solving the first equation. Then determine the distance by solving the second formula. (First equation: Δy = v_iy * t + 1/2 * g * t^2; Second equation: v = d / t)",
  "Observe the position-time graph of a vehicle that initially begins moving eastward and travels along a straight road. Indicate the total displacement of the vehicle at the end of the journey.",
  "During a baseball game, a ball with a mass of 0.145 kg is thrown at a speed of 46.9 m/s and comes to a complete stop in the catcher’s glove in 0.01 s. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force (F = m * a) that acted on the ball to stop it.",
  "Technology has played an important role in sports. For example, the implementation of technologies such as PITCH/fx, Rapsodo PITCHING 2.0, among others, has made it easier to detect the speed of baseball pitches with greater accuracy. In the history of Major League Baseball, the record speed of a ball during a pitch was 46.9 m/s. Assuming that a ball with a mass of 0.145 kg traveled at that speed and stopped in the catcher's glove 0.01 s after the pitch, calculate the average acceleration of the ball. Use the formula a = (v_f - v_i) / (t_f - t_i).",
  "A customer hurriedly pushes a shopping cart with a horizontal force of 120.0 N over a distance of 4.0 m in 3.0 s at a constant speed. How much power did the customer produce? (Use P = W/t, where work is the force applied over a distance.)",
  "A cyclist rides uphill without stopping. From which type of energy does the bicycle gain mechanical energy? (Adapted from Zitzewitz, 2004. Physics Principles and Problems. McGraw-Hill, p. 262.)",
  "When two wave pulses meet and overlap, what results are observed in cases (a) and (b)?",
  "In an electron microscope, electrons are accelerated through a potential difference of 2.0 x 10^5 V, reaching a maximum velocity of 2.7 x 10^8 m/s. Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. (Use h = 6.63 x 10^-34 J·s and m = 9.1 x 10^-31 kg, λ = h/mv.)",
  "It refers to the rate at which electric charges pass through a conductor over a period of time.",
  "Analyze Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation. If the planet Mars had triple its current mass while keeping the same size, would the value of G (gravitational constant) change?"
