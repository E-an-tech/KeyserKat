  "What is the function of a dependent variable?",
  "Bubbling observed during a chemical reaction is an example of what type of data?",
  "A skateboarder performs a horizontal jump at 5.0 m/s from a height of 2.0 m. How far horizontally will he fall? Calculate the flight time by solving the first equation. Then determine the distance by solving the second formula. (First equation: Δy = v_iy * t + 1/2 * g * t^2; Second equation: v = d / t)",
  "Observe the position-time graph of a vehicle that initially begins moving eastward and travels along a straight road. Indicate the total displacement of the vehicle at the end of the journey.",
  "During a baseball game, a ball with a mass of 0.145 kg is thrown at a speed of 46.9 m/s and comes to a complete stop in the catcher’s glove in 0.01 s. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force (F = m * a) that acted on the ball to stop it.",
  "During a game of pool, the cue ball, with a mass of 0.26 kg, moves at 1.3 m/s and hits the 8 ball, which has a mass of 0.15 kg and is at rest. After hitting it, the cue ball remains at rest. Calculate the final velocity of the 8 ball. Use the following formula: m1v1,i + m2v2,i = m1v1,f + m2v2,f.",
  "Identify and explain the differences between the types of energy represented in the following illustrations: (A) Soccer players in action, (B) An Olympic diver before jumping, (C) A compressed spring inside a pen.",
  "A customer hurriedly pushes a shopping cart with a horizontal force of 120.0 N over a distance of 4.0 m in 3.0 s at a constant speed. How much power did the customer produce? (Use P = W/t, where work is the force applied over a distance.)",
  "In an electron microscope, electrons are accelerated through a potential difference of 2.0 x 10^5 V, reaching a maximum velocity of 2.7 x 10^8 m/s. Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. (Use h = 6.63 x 10^-34 J·s and m = 9.1 x 10^-31 kg, λ = h/mv.)",
  "When two wave pulses meet and overlap, what results are observed in cases (a) and (b)?",
  "In the following circuit, which of the statements is correct?",
  "It is the work that must be done against electric forces to move a charge from a reference point to another point, divided by the charge."
