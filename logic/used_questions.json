  "Observe the position-time graph of a vehicle that initially begins moving eastward and travels along a straight road. Indicate the total displacement of the vehicle at the end of the journey.",
  "A skateboarder performs a horizontal jump at 5.0 m/s from a height of 2.0 m. How far horizontally will he fall? Calculate the flight time by solving the first equation. Then determine the distance by solving the second formula. (First equation: Δy = v_iy * t + 1/2 * g * t^2; Second equation: v = d / t)",
  "During a baseball game, a ball with a mass of 0.145 kg is thrown at a speed of 46.9 m/s and comes to a complete stop in the catcher’s glove in 0.01 s. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force (F = m * a) that acted on the ball to stop it.",
  "A box full of donated materials is resting on a table. When a strong push is applied with the hand, it slides across the surface and gradually comes to a stop. Using Newton’s First and Third Laws of Motion, explain why the box remains still before the push and why it eventually stops after being pushed.",
  "In a crash test, a red car with a mass of 2.80 x 10^3 kg is moving at 14.5 m/s and comes to a stop after colliding with a stationary car anchored to the ground. Calculate the change in the car's kinetic energy using ΔKE = KEf - KEi, where KE = (1/2)mv^2.",
  "A customer hurriedly pushes a shopping cart with a horizontal force of 120.0 N over a distance of 4.0 m in 3.0 s at a constant speed. How much power did the customer produce? (Use P = W/t, where work is the force applied over a distance.)",
  "In an electron microscope, electrons are accelerated through a potential difference of 2.0 x 10^5 V, reaching a maximum velocity of 2.7 x 10^8 m/s. Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. (Use h = 6.63 x 10^-34 J·s and m = 9.1 x 10^-31 kg, λ = h/mv.)",
  "Photocells, like those found in solar panels and calculators, work using the photoelectric effect, which describes a material's ability to generate electricity when exposed to light. If the threshold frequency for silicon is 3.2 x 10^13 Hz, calculate the maximum wavelength (λ) that can produce the photoelectric effect. (Use c = λ·f, where c = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.)",
  "The diagram shows the electrical circuit that powers a car's front headlights. This circuit is designed so that each lamp receives its full share of power. The headlights are connected in what type of circuit?",
  "It refers to the rate at which electric charges pass through a conductor over a period of time."
