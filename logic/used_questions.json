  "Observe the position-time graph of a vehicle that initially begins moving eastward and travels along a straight road. Indicate the total displacement of the vehicle at the end of the journey.",
  "A skateboarder performs a horizontal jump at 5.0 m/s from a height of 2.0 m. How far horizontally will he fall? Calculate the flight time by solving the first equation. Then determine the distance by solving the second formula. (First equation: Δy = v_iy * t + 1/2 * g * t^2; Second equation: v = d / t)",
  "Technology has played an important role in sports. For example, the implementation of technologies such as PITCH/fx, Rapsodo PITCHING 2.0, among others, has made it easier to detect the speed of baseball pitches with greater accuracy. In the history of Major League Baseball, the record speed of a ball during a pitch was 46.9 m/s. Assuming that a ball with a mass of 0.145 kg traveled at that speed and stopped in the catcher's glove 0.01 s after the pitch, calculate the average acceleration of the ball. Use the formula a = (v_f - v_i) / (t_f - t_i).",
  "During a game of pool, the cue ball, with a mass of 0.26 kg, moves at 1.3 m/s and hits the 8 ball, which has a mass of 0.15 kg and is at rest. After hitting it, the cue ball remains at rest. Calculate the final velocity of the 8 ball. Use the following formula: m1v1,i + m2v2,i = m1v1,f + m2v2,f.",
  "A customer hurriedly pushes a shopping cart with a horizontal force of 120.0 N over a distance of 4.0 m in 3.0 s at a constant speed. How much power did the customer produce? (Use P = W/t, where work is the force applied over a distance.)",
  "A cyclist rides uphill without stopping. From which type of energy does the bicycle gain mechanical energy? (Adapted from Zitzewitz, 2004. Physics Principles and Problems. McGraw-Hill, p. 262.)",
  "SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) technology determines the position of underwater objects by sending sound waves that reflect off surfaces and return to the source. On which wave property is SONAR primarily based?",
  "In an electron microscope, electrons are accelerated through a potential difference of 2.0 x 10^5 V, reaching a maximum velocity of 2.7 x 10^8 m/s. Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. (Use h = 6.63 x 10^-34 J·s and m = 9.1 x 10^-31 kg, λ = h/mv.)",
  "Analyze Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation. If the planet Mars had triple its current mass while keeping the same size, would the value of G (gravitational constant) change?",
  "According to Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation, the gravitational force between two objects ________ if the distance between them is doubled."
