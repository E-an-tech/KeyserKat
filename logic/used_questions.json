  "A skateboarder performs a horizontal jump at 5.0 m/s from a height of 2.0 m. How far horizontally will he fall? Calculate the flight time by solving the first equation. Then determine the distance by solving the second formula. (First equation: Δy = v_iy * t + 1/2 * g * t^2; Second equation: v = d / t)",
  "Observe the position-time graph of a vehicle that initially begins moving eastward and travels along a straight road. Indicate the total displacement of the vehicle at the end of the journey.",
  "During a game of pool, the cue ball, with a mass of 0.26 kg, moves at 1.3 m/s and hits the 8 ball, which has a mass of 0.15 kg and is at rest. After hitting it, the cue ball remains at rest. Calculate the final velocity of the 8 ball. Use the following formula: m1v1,i + m2v2,i = m1v1,f + m2v2,f.",
  "A box full of donated materials is resting on a table. When a strong push is applied with the hand, it slides across the surface and gradually comes to a stop. Using Newton’s First and Third Laws of Motion, explain why the box remains still before the push and why it eventually stops after being pushed.",
  "A customer hurriedly pushes a shopping cart with a horizontal force of 120.0 N over a distance of 4.0 m in 3.0 s at a constant speed. How much power did the customer produce? (Use P = W/t, where work is the force applied over a distance.)",
  "Identify and explain the differences between the types of energy represented in the following illustrations: (A) Soccer players in action, (B) An Olympic diver before jumping, (C) A compressed spring inside a pen.",
  "In an electron microscope, electrons are accelerated through a potential difference of 2.0 x 10^5 V, reaching a maximum velocity of 2.7 x 10^8 m/s. Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. (Use h = 6.63 x 10^-34 J·s and m = 9.1 x 10^-31 kg, λ = h/mv.)",
  "SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) technology determines the position of underwater objects by sending sound waves that reflect off surfaces and return to the source. On which wave property is SONAR primarily based?",
  "In the following circuit, which of the statements is correct?",
  "It refers to the rate at which electric charges pass through a conductor over a period of time."
