  "Observe the position-time graph of a vehicle that initially begins moving eastward and travels along a straight road. Indicate the total displacement of the vehicle at the end of the journey.",
  "A skateboarder performs a horizontal jump at 5.0 m/s from a height of 2.0 m. How far horizontally will he fall? Calculate the flight time by solving the first equation. Then determine the distance by solving the second formula. (First equation: \u0394y = v_iy * t + 1/2 * g * t^2; Second equation: v = d / t)",
  "A box full of donated materials is resting on a table. When a strong push is applied with the hand, it slides across the surface and gradually comes to a stop. Using Newton\u2019s First and Third Laws of Motion, explain why the box remains still before the push and why it eventually stops after being pushed.",
  "During a baseball game, a ball with a mass of 0.145 kg is thrown at a speed of 46.9 m/s and comes to a complete stop in the catcher\u2019s glove in 0.01 s. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force (F = m * a) that acted on the ball to stop it.",
  "A customer hurriedly pushes a shopping cart with a horizontal force of 120.0 N over a distance of 4.0 m in 3.0 s at a constant speed. How much power did the customer produce? (Use P = W/t, where work is the force applied over a distance.)",
  "In a crash test, a red car with a mass of 2.80 x 10^3 kg is moving at 14.5 m/s and comes to a stop after colliding with a stationary car anchored to the ground. Calculate the change in the car's kinetic energy using \u0394KE = KEf - KEi, where KE = (1/2)mv^2.",
  "SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) technology determines the position of underwater objects by sending sound waves that reflect off surfaces and return to the source. On which wave property is SONAR primarily based?",
  "In an electron microscope, electrons are accelerated through a potential difference of 2.0 x 10^5 V, reaching a maximum velocity of 2.7 x 10^8 m/s. Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. (Use h = 6.63 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s and m = 9.1 x 10^-31 kg, \u03bb = h/mv.)",
  "What force keeps satellites in orbit around Earth?",
  "It is the work that must be done against electric forces to move a charge from a reference point to another point, divided by the charge.",
