  "A skateboarder performs a horizontal jump at 5.0 m/s from a height of 2.0 m. How far horizontally will he fall? Calculate the flight time by solving the first equation. Then determine the distance by solving the second formula. (First equation: Δy = v_iy * t + 1/2 * g * t^2; Second equation: v = d / t)",
  "Observe the position-time graph of a vehicle that initially begins moving eastward and travels along a straight road. Indicate the total displacement of the vehicle at the end of the journey.",
  "A box full of donated materials is resting on a table. When a strong push is applied with the hand, it slides across the surface and gradually comes to a stop. Using Newton’s First and Third Laws of Motion, explain why the box remains still before the push and why it eventually stops after being pushed.",
  "Technology has played an important role in sports. For example, the implementation of technologies such as PITCH/fx, Rapsodo PITCHING 2.0, among others, has made it easier to detect the speed of baseball pitches with greater accuracy. In the history of Major League Baseball, the record speed of a ball during a pitch was 46.9 m/s. Assuming that a ball with a mass of 0.145 kg traveled at that speed and stopped in the catcher's glove 0.01 s after the pitch, calculate the average acceleration of the ball. Use the formula a = (v_f - v_i) / (t_f - t_i).",
  "A cyclist rides uphill without stopping. From which type of energy does the bicycle gain mechanical energy? (Adapted from Zitzewitz, 2004. Physics Principles and Problems. McGraw-Hill, p. 262.)",
  "In a crash test, a red car with a mass of 2.80 x 10^3 kg is moving at 14.5 m/s and comes to a stop after colliding with a stationary car anchored to the ground. Calculate the change in the car's kinetic energy using ΔKE = KEf - KEi, where KE = (1/2)mv^2.",
  "In an electron microscope, electrons are accelerated through a potential difference of 2.0 x 10^5 V, reaching a maximum velocity of 2.7 x 10^8 m/s. Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. (Use h = 6.63 x 10^-34 J·s and m = 9.1 x 10^-31 kg, λ = h/mv.)",
  "A SONAR system on a research ship emits a signal with a frequency of 1.50 x 10^5 Hz and a wavelength of 2.70 mm. Calculate the speed of the wave as it travels through the water. (Use v = f·λ.)",
  "Analyze Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation. If the planet Mars had triple its current mass while keeping the same size, would the value of G (gravitational constant) change?",
  "It is the work that must be done against electric forces to move a charge from a reference point to another point, divided by the charge."
