  "Bubbling observed during a chemical reaction is an example of what type of data?",
  "What is the function of a dependent variable?",
  "Observe the position-time graph of a vehicle that initially begins moving eastward and travels along a straight road. Indicate the total displacement of the vehicle at the end of the journey.",
  "A skateboarder performs a horizontal jump at 5.0 m/s from a height of 2.0 m. How far horizontally will he fall? Calculate the flight time by solving the first equation. Then determine the distance by solving the second formula. (First equation: Δy = v_iy * t + 1/2 * g * t^2; Second equation: v = d / t)",
  "During a stability test on a track, the maneuverability of a prototype race car with a mass of 1.6 x 10^3 kg was evaluated. On a curve with a radius of 30.0 m, the travel time was 3.8 s at a constant speed. Use the following formulas to calculate the speed and centripetal acceleration of the race car on the described path: v = 2πr / T and a_c = v^2 / r.",
  "During a game of pool, the cue ball, with a mass of 0.26 kg, moves at 1.3 m/s and hits the 8 ball, which has a mass of 0.15 kg and is at rest. After hitting it, the cue ball remains at rest. Calculate the final velocity of the 8 ball. Use the following formula: m1v1,i + m2v2,i = m1v1,f + m2v2,f.",
  "A customer hurriedly pushes a shopping cart with a horizontal force of 120.0 N over a distance of 4.0 m in 3.0 s at a constant speed. How much power did the customer produce? (Use P = W/t, where work is the force applied over a distance.)",
  "Identify and explain the differences between the types of energy represented in the following illustrations: (A) Soccer players in action, (B) An Olympic diver before jumping, (C) A compressed spring inside a pen.",
  "SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) technology determines the position of underwater objects by sending sound waves that reflect off surfaces and return to the source. On which wave property is SONAR primarily based?",
  "Photocells, like those found in solar panels and calculators, work using the photoelectric effect, which describes a material's ability to generate electricity when exposed to light. If the threshold frequency for silicon is 3.2 x 10^13 Hz, calculate the maximum wavelength (λ) that can produce the photoelectric effect. (Use c = λ·f, where c = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.)",
  "The diagram shows the electrical circuit that powers a car's front headlights. This circuit is designed so that each lamp receives its full share of power. The headlights are connected in what type of circuit?",
  "According to Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation, the gravitational force between two objects ________ if the distance between them is doubled."
