  "Bubbling observed during a chemical reaction is an example of what type of data?",
  "Why are SI (International system of measurements) units used in physics?",
  "A skateboarder performs a horizontal jump at 5.0 m/s from a height of 2.0 m. How far horizontally will he fall? Calculate the flight time by solving the first equation. Then determine the distance by solving the second formula. (First equation: Δy = v_iy * t + 1/2 * g * t^2; Second equation: v = d / t)",
  "Observe the position-time graph of a vehicle that initially begins moving eastward and travels along a straight road. Indicate the total displacement of the vehicle at the end of the journey.",
  "A box full of donated materials is resting on a table. When a strong push is applied with the hand, it slides across the surface and gradually comes to a stop. Using Newton’s First and Third Laws of Motion, explain why the box remains still before the push and why it eventually stops after being pushed.",
  "During a baseball game, a ball with a mass of 0.145 kg is thrown at a speed of 46.9 m/s and comes to a complete stop in the catcher’s glove in 0.01 s. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force (F = m * a) that acted on the ball to stop it.",
  "A customer hurriedly pushes a shopping cart with a horizontal force of 120.0 N over a distance of 4.0 m in 3.0 s at a constant speed. How much power did the customer produce? (Use P = W/t, where work is the force applied over a distance.)",
  "In a crash test, a red car with a mass of 2.80 x 10^3 kg is moving at 14.5 m/s and comes to a stop after colliding with a stationary car anchored to the ground. Calculate the change in the car's kinetic energy using ΔKE = KEf - KEi, where KE = (1/2)mv^2.",
  "When two wave pulses meet and overlap, what results are observed in cases (a) and (b)?",
  "In an electron microscope, electrons are accelerated through a potential difference of 2.0 x 10^5 V, reaching a maximum velocity of 2.7 x 10^8 m/s. Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. (Use h = 6.63 x 10^-34 J·s and m = 9.1 x 10^-31 kg, λ = h/mv.)",
  "Analyze Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation. If the planet Mars had triple its current mass while keeping the same size, would the value of G (gravitational constant) change?",
  "In the following circuit, which of the statements is correct?"
