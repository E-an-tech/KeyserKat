    "question": "Technology has played an important role in sports. For example, the implementation of technologies such as PITCH/fx, Rapsodo PITCHING 2.0, among others, has made it easier to detect the speed of baseball pitches with greater accuracy. In the history of Major League Baseball, the record speed of a ball during a pitch was 46.9 m/s. Assuming that a ball with a mass of 0.145 kg traveled at that speed and stopped in the catcher's glove 0.01 s after the pitch, calculate the average acceleration of the ball. Use the formula a = (v_f - v_i) / (t_f - t_i).",

    "question": "A box full of donated materials is resting on a table. When a strong push is applied with the hand, it slides across the surface and gradually comes to a stop. Using Newton’s First and Third Laws of Motion, explain why the box remains still before the push and why it eventually stops after being pushed.",
    "user_answer": "The box remains still because there are no forces acting on it, and it stops because the applied force disappears.",
