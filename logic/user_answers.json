    "question": "A box full of donated materials is resting on a table. When a strong push is applied with the hand, it slides across the surface and gradually comes to a stop. Using Newton’s First and Third Laws of Motion, explain why the box remains still before the push and why it eventually stops after being pushed.",
    "user_answer": "The box remains still because of inertia, and it stops because friction acts in the opposite direction of motion.",
